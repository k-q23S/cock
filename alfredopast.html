        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces dried fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 pound total)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
            <li>   2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
            <li>   8 tablespoons (1 stick) European-style unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>   2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>  1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li> 1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese (2 1/2 ounces), plus more for serving</li>
            <li>  1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>  Coarsely chopped fresh parsley leaves, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>Cook the pasta, drain, and reserve cooking water. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Dry the chicken and season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, pat both sides of the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. Season with 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil over medium-high in a large frying pan. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until shimmering, 2 to 3 minutes. If you have a pan that has straight sides, here's the time to use it. Do not use a nonstick pan.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken to the hot pan, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes</li>
        <li>Flip the chicken and cook for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the chicken reaches 165°F.</li>
        <li>Slice the chicken and cover to keep warm. Melt the rest of the butter and sauté the garlic. </li>
        <li>Make the Alfredo sauce. Whisk in the cream, Parmesan, nutmeg, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.</li>
        <li>Add the drained pasta and toss to coat in the sauce. Add the drained fettuccine to the sauce and toss to coat. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
