        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly</li>
            <li>1½ cups packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons vanilla</li>
            <li>2½ cups semisweet chocolate chips (16 ounces)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat together butter and sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until pale and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Lightly beat 1 egg with a fork in a small bowl and add 1¾ tablespoons of it plus 2 remaining whole eggs to butter mixture, beating with mixer until creamy, about 1 minute. Beat in vanilla. Reduce speed to low and mix in flour mixture until just blended, then stir in chips.</li>
        <li>Scoop ¼ cup batter for each cookie, arranging mounds 3 inches apart, on 2 baking sheets. Flatten mounds into 3-inch rounds using moistened palm of your hand. Form remaining cookies on additional sheets of parchment.</li>
        <li>Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until golden, 13 to 15 minutes. Transfer cookies to a rack to cool and continue making cookies in same manner using cooled baking sheets. </li>
